### Hi, my name is Khanh, an HR Data Analyst base in Vietnam

I have 4 years of experience in HR, working across both HR operations and data support, mainly in education and service sectors. I have several projects built on real data which you can explore here, certain details have been intentionally anonymized or masked to comply with data privacy and confidentiality requirements

I work a lot with HR processes and people metrics such as hiring performance, turnover rate, background check and furthermore to understand where problems come from. From there, I build dashboards and insights that help HR teams see issues more clearly and make better decisions

I’m looking for an opportunity in an HR Data / People Analytics team, preferably in a fast-growing environment where data is actually used to improve how things work

### Tools I use:
